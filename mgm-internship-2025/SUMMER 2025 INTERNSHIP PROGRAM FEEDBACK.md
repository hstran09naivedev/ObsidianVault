### 1. POSITIVE ASPECTS

**Work Environment:**

- Good infrastructure and professional working environment
- Open company culture with relaxed dress code
- Friendly and supportive colleagues

**Knowledge and Skills:**

- Training program received positive feedback
- Interns gained substantial practical knowledge, particularly in Scrum processes and Git
- Opportunities to work with modern technologies (Java, TypeScript, AI tools)

### 2. AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

**Internship Duration:**

- Multiple feedback indicating 2 months is too short for interns to effectively learn and contribute
- **Recommendation:** Extend internship period to 3 months

**Technical Support:**

- Frontend code reviews were not as thorough due to staff rotation and mentors not specializing in Frontend
- Created an imbalanced experience between Frontend and Backend interns
- **Recommendation:** Ensure mentors are matched according to their technical expertise with intern groups

**Facilities:**

- Meeting rooms may be insufficient when teams are large
- Several interns experienced issues with personal computers breaking down during the internship
- **Recommendation:** Consider providing company laptops for interns

### Conclusion
The internship program received overall positive feedback regarding the work environment and training quality. However, adjustments should be considered for the program duration, better alignment of mentor expertise with intern specializations


HCMC doesn't like Da Nang, we can deal on the last week of internship

Training programs -> we could remove it or create some standard of knowledge before starting the project
