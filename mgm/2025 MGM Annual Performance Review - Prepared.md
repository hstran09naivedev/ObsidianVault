## 1. Part: Personnel Development (Technical Part)

### üìã Tasks / Competencies / Project experience

#### **Feedback about the current tasks by the employee**

**Technical Growth & New Experiences:**

- Gained hands-on experience with new technical tasks: Environment setup, security scanning, SBOM generation - areas I had limited exposure to previously, but successfully completed
- Consistently delivered all assigned tasks within required timelines
- Participated in an interesting technical project (voicechat) - expanded technical exposure and skills

**Leadership & Mentoring:**

- Successfully mentored the Internship Program in HCMC across multiple aspects - achieved strong results in developing intern capabilities
- First-time experience as Product Owner - though scope was limited, it provided valuable learning experience in product management

**Challenges & Lessons Learned:**

- **Project Management:** Roles and responsibilities in projects were not clearly defined (e.g., voicechat project). Created personal TODO system after meetings and used WebEx for tracking. Learned to be proactive and self-organizing in ambiguous situations
- **Documentation:** When mentoring interns, limited historical information available. Built program foundation and standards from scratch, developing ability to create comprehensive programs without existing templates
- **Communication:** Improved handling of different accents and communication styles through focused listening during meetings

#### **General feedback to mgm**

The work environment at MGM remains friendly and supportive. Employee care and attention to well-being are excellent. I appreciate the collaborative culture and the opportunities provided for professional growth.

#### **Feedback and wishes to the technical Team Lead**

Management style is enthusiastic and supportive. Technical sharing is very detailed and thorough - sometimes more detailed than necessary, but this ensures everyone understands correctly and minimizes errors.

**Strengths:** Ensures accurate understanding and reduces mistakes through comprehensive explanations

**Suggestion:** Could balance detail level with time efficiency when appropriate, especially for routine tasks

### üë• Team / Project(s)

#### **Feedback to the team / atmosphere**

Team atmosphere has improved significantly compared to last year. Previously felt some interpersonal tensions or communication barriers (possibly cultural differences), but this year the working relationships are much more comfortable and natural. Overall team spirit is positive and collaborative. Everyone maintains a friendly and supportive approach to work.

### üéì Training and coaching

#### **Completed trainings in the last year**

- Self-directed Java training (personal initiative, completed at home)
- Limited formal company training participation this year

#### **Did the training provide any added value for your daily work? If so, how?**

The Java training enhanced my programming foundation and improved code quality in current projects. Self-directed learning also developed my ability to identify and pursue relevant skill development independently.

#### **General suggestions for improvement / feedback to the training & coaching team**

Would benefit from more structured learning paths in emerging technologies. Consider offering training roadmaps for different technical tracks (AI/ML, DevOps, etc.)

#### **To what extent does mgm support you in your personal and professional development?**

MGM provides a good support framework for development through mentoring opportunities and project variety. The internship mentoring role particularly helped develop leadership skills. Would appreciate more formal training programs in cutting-edge technologies.

#### **Training requests / needs:**
