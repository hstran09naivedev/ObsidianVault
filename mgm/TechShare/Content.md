# Very Early Stage
## Challenges
Don't know how to start/kickoff a project in mgm
Don't know which topic should suit for the internship program -> Go with the flow
Don't understand frontend very well for a complete output -> Everything will be fine :D
Only me for the whole project - Too many perspectives/things to worry about? -> Me? I'm worry? No :))

# Early Stage
### Technical 
Java - Springboot - Typescript - React - Jenkins for CICD - docker artifactory from mgm - VM for product deployment

### Product 
Topic to choose -> How the internship's product looks like. Below is what I have

**Niche social network for memes** - image editor on FE side > No 
A software that can share the technical ideas, tips, tricks, a12 knowledge... replacing ***Today I learned*** group chat
We can receive digest emails to recommend user for some good contents

Create **Product Vision**:
**FOR** employees in our organization  
**WHO** need to find solutions quickly and share their expertise efficiently,  
**THE** Knowledge Hub is an internal knowledge sharing application  
**THAT** captures, organizes, and surfaces collective wisdom in real-time,  
**UNLIKE** generic wikis or chat channels,  
**OUR PRODUCT** Uses community-driven curation ~~and gamified contributions~~ to make knowledge sharing as natural and rewarding as social media.

Create :
User personas
Activities
Tasks
Stories


### Process
To work through 2 months - output -> discipline
#### Core conditions to start and sustain Scrum

**Team Structure**
**Commitment to Scrum Events**
**Sprint Cadence**
**Self-Organization and Cross-Functionality**
**Clear Definition of Done**

##### 1. Dedicated Scrum Team
- **Roles**: Clearly assigned Scrum roles — Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.
- **Team Size**: Typically 3–9 Development Team members (optimal for communication and collaboration).
##### 2. Product Backlog

- **Presence of Backlog**: An ordered list of product features, enhancements, fixes, and technical tasks.
- **Owned by Product Owner**: Product Owner manages and prioritizes backlog items.

##### 3. Commitment to Scrum Events

- **Sprint Planning**: Regular meetings to plan the upcoming sprint.
- **Daily Standup (Daily Scrum)**: Timeboxed (15 minutes) daily meeting for the team to synchronize.
- **Sprint Review**: End-of-sprint demonstration and feedback session for the increment.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: End-of-sprint reflection on process improvement.

##### 4. Clear Definition of Done

- The team agrees on what “Done” means for increment work. This ensures quality and transparency.

---

##### 5. Sprint Cadence**

- Fixed, consistent sprint length (normally 1–4 weeks).
- Commitment to delivering a “potentially shippable product increment” every sprint.

---

##### 6. Self-Organization and Cross-Functionality**

- Team is empowered to decide how to complete work.
- Team includes all necessary skills to deliver the product increment.

---

##### 7. Transparency and Openness**

- All work and process are visible to stakeholders.
- Tools for transparency: Task boards, burn-down charts, etc.

---

##### 8. Stakeholder Engagement**

- Stakeholders willing to participate in reviews and communicate requirements.

---

##### 9. Organizational Support**

- Management and organizational buy-in for Scrum framework.
- Support for team autonomy and time-boxed processes.
