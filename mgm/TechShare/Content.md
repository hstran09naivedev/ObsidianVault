# Very Early Stage
## Challenges
Don't know how to start/kickoff a project in mgm
Don't know which topic should suit for the internship program -> Go with the flow
Don't understand frontend very well for a complete output -> Everything will be fine :D
Only me for the whole project - Too many perspectives/things to worry about? -> Me? I'm worry? No :))

# Early Stage
### Technical 
Java - Springboot - Typescript - React - Jenkins for CICD - docker artifactory from mgm - VM for product deployment

### Product 
Topic to choose -> How the internship's product looks like. Below is what I have

**Niche social network for memes** - image editor on FE side > No 
A software that can share the technical ideas, tips, tricks, a12 knowledge... replacing ***Today I learned*** group chat
We can receive digest emails to recommend user for some good contents

Define and Orient Product - **Product Vision**:
**FOR** employees in our organization  
**WHO** need to find solutions quickly and share their expertise efficiently,  
**THE** Knowledge Hub is an internal knowledge sharing application  
**THAT** captures, organizes, and surfaces collective wisdom in real-time,  
**UNLIKE** generic wikis or chat channels,  
**OUR PRODUCT** Uses community-driven curation ~~and gamified contributions~~ to make knowledge sharing as natural and rewarding as social media.

**Planning**
User Story Map (TopDown)
 
**Personas**: Consumer/Publisher - Admin -> Participant - Admin
**Activities**: Authen  - Discover - Create - Engage - Self Organization - Manage Platform
**Tasks**: Login, Logout, Forget Pasword, Reset Password - Browser and Explore, Search, Read -

This template answer the question when define a backlog item:
Who, what, why in business perspective only 
UINVEST - **Acceptance Criteria**
### Process
To work through 2 months - output -> discipline
#### Core conditions to start and sustain Scrum

**Team Structure** - Product Owner - Scrum Master - Development team (- Technical Lead) (3-9 members)
**Commitment to Scrum Events** (Planning - Daily - Retro - Review)
**Sprint Cadence** (potentially shippable product increment” every **sprint**)
**Self-Organization and Cross-Functionality** (empowered to decide how to complete work, all necessary skills to deliver the product increment)
**Clear Definition of Done** (The team agrees on what “Done” means for increment work. This ensures quality and transparency)


### Development
Authentication & Authorization
Database Design
Recommendation System (User-based Filtering & Item-based filtering - Collaborative filtering) 
Clean Code Architecture
Redis Realtime Notification
CICD Setup - reverse proxy Setup (NGINX)

### Outcome
