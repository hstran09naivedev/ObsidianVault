## Template

I have code in my [Project name] that needs review/refactoring:

**Current code:**
[paste code here]
**Goal:** [improve performance/clean code/fix bug/add feature/etc.]
**Context:** [explain what this code does in the project]

**Important:** If you need more context about how this code fits into the larger project, its dependencies, or specific requirements, please ask. I'd rather discuss details than have you work with incomplete information.

Please analyze and provide:
1. Assessment of current code (what issues need fixing)
2. Refactoring suggestions

If extensive refactoring is needed, break it into small steps and show only the first step. I'll confirm "DONE" after each step.
